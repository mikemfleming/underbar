# UNDERBAR

This repo contains code that will get you a little more comfortable 
with JavaScript. It teaches functional programming concepts and JavaScript 
fundamentals (like array methods) by having you create your own versions
of functions from the popular Underscore library. It assumes that you are
on a Mac with Git installed already.

## Installation
In your terminal, run:
```bash
# clone the repo from github to your working directory
git clone https://github.com/mikemfleming/underbar.git

# change into the resulting directory
cd underbar

# open the spec runner in your browser
open SpecRunner.html
```

## SpecRunner.html
This file contains all the tests that will run against the functions
you write in this exercise. See all the red x's? That's the tests
running against all the functions that you haven't written yet.
Keep this open in your browser and refresh it whenever you would
like to run your code against the tests. 

## src/underbar.js
This is where you will actually write your code. The instructions are
mostly in the comments so make sure you read and follow those. 

Good luck!
